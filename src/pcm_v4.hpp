// pcm_v4.hpp — decoder for UberSDR audio protocol version 4.
//
// Self-contained and header-only, so the driver stays the single translation
// unit CMakeLists.txt builds and the zip stays a short list of files somebody
// unpacks and compiles.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// Versions 1 to 3 wrapped every lossless packet in a zstd frame and put a fixed
// 29- or 37-byte header on it. zstd does not compress this data: measured
// against a live receiver every IQ mode came back at 0.99x, the compressed
// stream consistently LARGER than the samples it carried, because zstd is an
// LZ77 matcher over bytes and a band-limited RF signal has no repeated byte
// strings.
//
// It does have redundancy, just not that kind — consecutive samples correlate
// at |r(1)| = 0.78-0.90 on IQ — and a predictor plus an entropy coder suited to
// residuals extracts it. Version 4 replaces the wrapper with exactly that, and
// the fixed header with one carrying only what changed. On the rates this
// driver uses: 384 kHz IQ falls from 1590 kB/s to 1116, and 48 kHz from 199.6
// to 140.4.
//
// HOW IT WORKS
// ------------
// Each sample is predicted from those before it by an adaptive filter and only
// the prediction error is sent, Rice coded. The filter is BACKWARD adaptive:
// its taps are derived from samples already decoded, so this side recomputes
// them independently and no coefficients are ever transmitted.
//
// That is what makes every arithmetic detail below load-bearing. All state is
// integer with shifts, never floating point, so the Go server and this decoder
// agree bit for bit — but only if the rounding of the prediction sum, the sign
// convention, the tap clamp, the order in which stages are inverted and the
// point at which the fast path skips the clamp all match exactly. A difference
// in any of them does not fail loudly; it returns plausible-looking noise.
//
// The reference is pcm_predictive.go and pcm_v4_header.go in the server tree,
// and the conformance test in test/ decodes a packet stream that the server's
// own encoder produced.
//
// PROFILES: THE SERVER DECIDES
// ----------------------------
// Each packet declares the profile it was coded with. This driver reads the
// declaration and obeys it; it never infers the predictor from the mode or the
// channel count. Both profiles are implemented even though a driver that only
// tunes IQ modes should only ever meet the complex one — the server's choice is
// policy it may retune per band, and the cost of being ready for that is one
// small class.
//
// An unknown profile id is a hard error rather than a fallback, for the reason
// above: decoding with the wrong predictor would return noise and call it
// signal.
